# Horiseon Code Refactor
## Description

This project is a code refractor for the Horiseon webpage. The purpose of this refactoring is to make the previous code provided more efficient, comprehensible, and accessible. This refactoring should also result in an improved search engine. The modifications do not change the overall display of the page nor does it change the underlying code.

## Usage

Once deployed, the application appears as the image attached below on a traditional desktop. This site is not yet optimized for smaller screens. 

<img 
src="./assets/images/Horiseon-Screenshot.png"
alt="A screenshot of the Horiseon webpage" />

## Tasks Completed

- Redundant classes were consolidated
- HTML Elements were replaced with semantic HTML Elements
- Alt text was added to images
- Explanatory comments were provided in the HTML document
- CSS was reorganized to follow a logical structure
    ~ Classes and elements were separated, the ordered alphabetically within each group
    ~ Comments were added to delineate each separation
- A descriptive title was added
